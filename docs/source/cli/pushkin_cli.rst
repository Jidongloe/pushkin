.. _pushkin_cli:

Pushkin CLI
=============
The Pushkin command-line package is available via NPM. We highly recommend a global install in order to make working with Pushkin projects as easy as possible. ``npm install -g pushkin-cli`` will add the ``pushkin`` command to your path. It has the following subcommands:

init
-------------
Syntax: ``pushkin init``

Run in an empty directory to initialize the space with a new Pushkin project.

----------------

generate
-------------
Syntax: ``pushkin generate [expshortname]``

Run inside a Pushkin project to create an experiment from a boilerplate starting point.

----------------

prep
--------------
Syntax: ``pushkin prep``

Run inside a Pushkin project to prepare Pushkin to be run. Packages generated by calling ``npm pack`` inside each experiment's web page and api controllers directories are moved to the core Pushkin code, installed there, and linked to the core code. Previous modules are uninstalled and removed.

----------------

setupdb
----------------
Syntax: ``pushkin setupdb``

Runs migrations and seeds for experiments. Ensures experiments using the same database (as defined in ``pushkin.yaml``) are migrated at the same time to avoid errors with the knex_migrations table.

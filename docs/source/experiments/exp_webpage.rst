Experiment Web Page Component
==============================
This houses the front-end component of an experiment. A package.json file describes the data here, which is packaged by the CLI and attached to the core website under the location defined by the experiment's config file. Pushkin uses React for the front end. Experiment web pages are mounted as React components and given the full size of the screen.
